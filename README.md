# Offline-Radio
Simple program to act as a radio by using flask.
> Updating README later.

## How do I use it?

Extract the program / files into a folder of your choice and create a stations/ directory.
In that directory, you can create a multitude of other folders - these will be your stations that you can place WAV files in.

Once you do that, you can run the program and it will open up the webpage. (usually localhost:5000)
You can change between stations or listen to one through there.
